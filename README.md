# transactionsApp

We are looking to build a money accounting web application
which tracks money flow of the organization.
The application will be hosted on a highly secured host with its own auth system. So don't worry
about authentication.
The "must-have" features:
● The App must be able to receive credit and debit transactions.
● Any transaction, which leads to negative amount in the system, should be refused.
Please provide http code which you think suits best for this situation.
● The App must store transactions history.
● In general, the App will be used programmatically via its RESTful API.
